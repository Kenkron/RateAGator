An overview of guidelines to follow when making/using the UI.
It will be expanded as more guidelines are created

1)  When a new activity needs to retrieve data from an Intent,
	the id strings should be constants stored in the activity
	class, not magic strings.  The names of these constant 
	Strings should be in all caps, and start with INTENT_
	This ensures that the id strings cannot be misspelled or 
	confusing.
